An attempt at a basic, customizable dungeon crawling game. It has a map system

## Gameplay

In this level, we have no strength, and cannot even withstand one attack, so
we must avoid the enemies and make it to the victory tile. In other levels, we
must kill all the enemies. In some levels, you can either kill all of the
enemies or make it to the tile, and sometimes you must do both.

_A standardized way to observe Django's internals._

Observability is critical feature of software development, but tends to be neglected. It seems like the majority of Python APMs and observability tools have to monkey-patch Django's internals to properly observe the application. This library seeks to do that monkey-patching once, then provide a standardized set of signals/hooks to observe an application.

## Motivation

Standard audio models use ~120ms patches, which is too coarse for bird song where syllables contain rapid frequency modulations. We combine LeJEPA's theoretically-grounded self-supervised objective with SongMAE's 2ms temporal resolution to learn representations that capture fine-grained acoustic structure without labeled data.
